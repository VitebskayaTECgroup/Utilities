In the 2-Sided mode, two-sided originals can also be automatically turned over and scanned as two-sided documents.¶Document Sizes¶The machine automatically detects the size of the original when scanning it. When you fax a document, the recipient’s fax machine may not be able to print the received data on paper of the same size as the scanned document’s. In this case, the original image is either reduced in size or divided into smaller parts before being sent.¶The machine may not always detect the size of the original, especially if it is a nonstandard size paper, such as a book. In this case, manually specify the size at which you want to scan the original.¶Orientation¶You can place an original either vertically (portrait) or horizontally (landscape). When using the platen glass, always align the top left corner of the original (face down) with the platen glass corner indicated by an arrow. When using the feeder, align the top edge of your original (face up) with the back edge of the feeder.¶Platen Glass (View from Above)¶¶Vertical Placement¶¶Horizontal Placement¶Feeder (View from Above)¶¶Vertical Placement¶¶Horizontal Placement¶¶NOTE¶If the top left corner of the original (face down) is not aligned with that of the platen glass, the original may not be scanned correctly.¶LTR and STMT originals can be placed either vertically or horizontally. However, the scanning speed for horizontally placed originals is somewhat slower than for vertically placed originals. Place originals horizontally when printing with a preset copy ratio, such as when enlarging an LTR original onto LGL or 11&quot; × 17&quot; paper. (Basic Copying Features)¶Horizontally placed LTR and STMT originals are referred to as LTRR and STMTR respectively.¶LGL or 11&quot; × 17&quot; originals must be placed horizontally.¶To achieve the same output orientation using the feeder as when the original is placed on the platen glass, place the original upside down and face up. However, if an appropriate size of paper is not loaded in the Staple mode, the output is rotated automatically.¶¶Platen Glass¶Use the platen glass when scanning bound originals (such as books and magazines), heavy or lightweight originals, and transparencies. When copying ID cards using the ID Card Copy function, you must use the platen glass. (Advanced Copying Features)¶1¶Lift the feeder/platen cover.¶¶2¶Place your original face down.¶The original that you want to copy must be placed face down. Align the top left corner of the original with the platen glass corner indicated by an arrow.¶¶Place books and other bound originals on the platen glass in the same way as described above.¶¶NOTE:¶When you are enlarging an LTR or STMT original onto LGL or 11&quot; × 17&quot; paper, place the original horizontally on the platen glass and align it with the LTRR or STMTR marks.¶3¶Gently close the feeder/platen cover.¶¶¶Close the feeder/platen cover gently to avoid catching your hands, as this may result in personal injury.¶Do not press down hard on the feeder/platen cover when using the platen glass. Doing so may damage the platen glass and result in personal injury.¶¶When scanning is complete, lift the feeder/platen cover, and remove the original from the platen glass.¶¶IMPORTANT:¶Before scanning LTRR or STMT originals placed on the platen glass, make sure that the size of the original is correctly set.¶NOTE:¶The machine automatically detects the size of LTR, LTRR, LGL, 11&quot; × 17&quot; originals. If the size of the original is not detected, press  (Start) → follow the instructions on the screen to specify the original’s size. You can also manually select the paper size. (Basic Copying Features)¶Feeder (Optional)¶Use the feeder when you want to scan several originals at a time. With the feeder, the machine automatically feeds the originals to the scanning area and scans them. If you are scanning in the 2-Sided mode, two-sided originals can also be automatically turned over and scanned as two-sided documents.¶Originals loaded in the feeder must meet the requirements outlined below.¶Size¶LTR, LTRR, LGL, 11&quot; × 17&quot;, and STMT¶Weight¶DADF-AB1:¶14 to 28 lb bond [52 to 105 g/m2] (10 to 14 lb bond [37 to 52 g/m2] and 28 to 34 lb bond [105 to 128 g/m2] when scanning a single page document)¶¶IMPORTANT¶The Feeder (DADF-AB1) is optional.¶Do not place the following types of originals in the feeder:¶Originals with tears, five or more binding holes, or cutouts¶Severely curled originals or originals with sharp folds¶Wrinkled originals¶Stapled originals or originals with paper clips¶Tabbed originals¶Originals with adhesive tape or glue¶Originals that are taped together¶Carbon backed paper or other originals which may not feed smoothly¶Transparencies and other highly transparent originals¶If the same original is fed through the feeder repeatedly, the original may fold or become creased, making it impossible to feed. Limit repeated feeding to a maximum of 30 times. (This number may vary depending on the type and quality of the original.)¶Clean the feeder regularly. (Feeder Scanning Area and Rollers) The feeder rollers may become dirty if originals written in pencil are scanned.¶Always smooth out any folds in your originals before placing them into the feeder. ¶Set the originals one by one when scanning very thin (10 to 14 lb bond [37 to 52 g/m2]) or very thick (28 to 34 lb bond [105 to 128 g/m2]) originals with the optional Feeder (DADF-AB1).¶¶1¶Adjust the slide guides to fit the size of your originals.¶¶2¶Neatly place your originals with the side to be scanned face up into the original supply tray.¶Place your originals as far into the feeder as they will go.¶Make sure that the height of the paper stack does not exceed the loading limit mark ( or ).¶¶¶Do not insert your fingers into the gaps around the original supply tray, as your fingers may get caught.¶¶IMPORTANT:¶Be careful not to drop objects such as paper clips into the gaps, as they may damage the machine or cause it to break down.¶¶IMPORTANT:¶Do not add or remove originals while they are being scanned.¶When scanning is complete, remove the originals from the original output area to avoid paper jams.¶Do not place any objects in the original output area. Blocking the original output area may damage the originals fed through the feeder, or cause paper jams.¶NOTE¶The scanned originals are output to the original output area in the order that they are fed into the feeder.¶When you are enlarging an LTR original onto LGL or 11&quot; × 17&quot; paper, place the original horizontally.¶You can place different size originals together into the feeder if you set the Different Size Originals mode.

User Authentication Feature for Send Operation, also called Authentication at Send, is a feature that enables you to prevent unauthorized users from sending documents from the machine. With this feature activated, any user who wants to send documents needs to enter a valid user name and password.¶Flow of Sending Documents with Authentication at Send¶¶1. A user who attempts to send documents is prompted to enter a valid user name and password.2. Entered information is checked in the authentication server against the directory database to authenticate the user.3.

The accepted message format and file types are as follows:¶Message Format: Plain text¶File Types: TIFF-F (MH, MR, MMR compression), JPEG¶You cannot read e-mail messages on the machine’s display.¶¶Receiving Documents Automatically¶The following describes how the machine works when documents are received.¶1¶When documents are being received, the Processing/Data indicator on the control panel flashes a green light.¶¶NOTE:¶During reception, the transaction number is displayed on the touch panel display.¶2¶When document reception is complete, the Processing/Data indicator on the control panel maintains a steady green light. This indicates that documents are stored in memory.¶¶NOTE:¶The Processing/Data indicator flashes or maintains a steady green light even when the machine enters the Sleep mode.¶The Error indicator flashes when either the amount of available memory is low or paper needs to be loaded into a paper drawer.¶3¶The document is printed.¶The Processing/Data indicator goes out when documents stored in memory are printed.¶NOTE:¶If there is no paper on which the received documents can be printed, the received documents are stored in memory. Documents stored in memory are automatically printed when paper is loaded into a paper drawer.¶The memory can hold a total of approximately 1,000 pages for sending and receiving documents.¶If a printing error occurs, the Error indicator flashes a red light.¶When the machine receives I-fax documents, the sender’s I-fax address and the subject of the I-fax documents are always printed at the top of the first page. (If the first page of the I-fax documents contains the body text, the sender’s I-fax address and the subject are not printed.)¶¶Receiving I-Fax Documents Manually¶The machine regularly checks for the arrival of an I-fax. However, you can check for the arrival of an I-fax at any time by performing the procedure below.¶1¶Press [System Monitor].¶¶2¶Press [RX/TX].¶¶3¶Select [RX Job Report].¶¶4¶Press [Check RX I-Fax Job].¶¶The machine accesses your mail server for checking for I-fax documents.¶NOTE:¶To be able to use [Check RX I-Fax Job], you must first set the POP (Post Office Protocol) settings in E-mail/I-Fax so that you can receive documents using POP.

If a received document matches the specified forwarding conditions, it is forwarded to the specified destination. Received documents that do not match the forwarding conditions can also be forwarded to any desired destination.¶¶To use this feature, see Setting the Send Function.¶IMPORTANT¶If a blackout occurs or the machine is turned OFF while the machine is receiving the documents to be forwarded, the received documents are not forwarded to the specified destination. These documents are printed after the power is turnd ON.¶¶Receiving Documents in Memory without Printing Out (Memory Lock)¶Normally a document is printed as soon as you receive it. However, there may be occasions when you want the machine to store all documents in memory until you are ready to print them. Locking the machine to receive and store all documents in memory is called Memory Lock.¶¶To use this feature, see Setting the Send Function.¶IMPORTANT¶Additional documents cannot be received in memory in any of the following cases (the numbers below may vary depending on the remaining capacity of memory): ¶When a total of 95 documents (75 documents if only I-fax documents are stored) have been stored in memory¶When a total of approximately 1,000 pages have been stored in memory¶When a total of 90 received documents or 99 report jobs are waiting to be printed while the machine is out of paper.¶Even if a blackout occurs or the machine is turned OFF, a built-in battery retains the documents received in memory for about an hour. However, if the battery is not fully charged, the documents may not be retained. (To fully charge the built-in battery, it takes about two hours after the main power switch is turned ON.)¶¶NOTE¶The System Monitor screen enables you to check, delete, and forward documents received in memory.

This is a must-read for all users and administrators before using this machine, other printers, and multifunction machines connected to the network. In recent years, a printer/multifunction machine connected to the network can offer you a variety of useful functions, such as printing from a computer, operating from a computer using the remote function, and sending scanned documents via the Internet. On the other hand, it is essential to take security measures to reduce the security risk for information leakage, as a printer/multifunction machine has become more exposed to threats, such as unauthorized access and theft, when it is connected to the network. This section explains necessary settings you need to specify to prevent unauthorized access before using a printer/multifunction machine connected to the network.¶Security Measures to Prevent Unauthorized Access from the External Network¶Assigning a Private IP Address¶Using Firewall to Restrict Transmission¶Specifying the TLS Encrypted Communication¶Setting PIN to Manage Information Stored in the Multifunction Machine¶Assigning a Private IP Address¶An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network. A &quot;global IP address&quot; is used for the communication connecting to the Internet, and a &quot;private IP address&quot; is used for the communication within a local area network, such as a LAN in the company. If a global IP address is assigned, your printer/multifunction machine is open to the public and can be accessed via the Internet. Thus, the risk of information leakage due to unauthorized access from external network increases. On the other hand, if a private IP address is assigned, your printer/multifunction machine is closed to a local area network and can be accessed by only users on your local area network, such as a LAN in the company.¶¶ ¶¶Global IP Address¶Can be accessed from the users within a local area network¶¶Private IP Address¶Can be accessed from the users within a local area network¶¶Basically, assign a private IP address to your printer/multifunction machine. Make sure to confirm the IP address, assigned to the printer/multifunction machine you are using, is a private IP address or not. A private IP address is found in one of the following ranges.¶Ranges for Private IP addresses¶From 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255¶From 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255¶From 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255¶For information on how to confirm the IP address, see Setting IPv4 Address.¶NOTE¶If a global IP address is assigned to a printer/multifunction machine, you can create a network environment to reduce the risk of unauthorized access by installing security software, such as a firewall that prevents access from the external networks. If you want to assign a global IP address to and use a printer/multifunction machine, contact your network administrator.¶¶Using Firewall to Restrict Transmission¶A firewall is a system that prevents unauthorized access from the external networks and protects against attacks/intrusions to a local area network. You can use a firewall on your network environment to block access from the external network that appears to be dangerous, by restricting communication from specified IP address of the external network. The function installed to a Canon printer/multifunction machine enables you to set up the IP address filter. For information on how to set up an IP address filter, see Restricting Access from Computers on the Network.¶Specifying the TLS Encrypted Communication¶For information on the TLS Encrypted Communication, see Managing Key Pairs and Digital Certificates, and on the procedures to specify, see Restricting the Remote UI.¶Setting PIN to Manage Information Stored in the Multifunction Machine¶If a malicious third party attempts to gain unauthorized access to a printer/multifunction machine, setting PIN to information stored in the machine will reduce the risk of information leakage. Canon printer/multifunction machine enables you to protect various type of information by setting PIN.¶Setting PIN to Each Function¶Setting PIN for Using Remote UI¶For more information, see Restricting the Use of Remote UI.¶Setting PIN for the System Manager Settings¶For more information, see Setting System Management Mode.¶Address Book PIN¶For more information on setting a PIN, see Setting a Password for the Address Book.¶Listed above are some examples of security measures for preventing unauthorized access.

A typical 802.1X network consists of a RADIUS server (authentication server), LAN switch (authenticator), and client devices with authentication software (supplicant).¶¶The machine can connect to an 802.1X network as a client device. After installing and registering the required key pair and digital certificates, select the method of EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol). The EAP methods supported by the machine are outlined below.¶NOTE¶Key pairs and digital certificates can be installed from a web browser (Remote UI). (Managing Jobs and Machine Data)¶Key pairs and digital certificates can be registered both with the control panel and from a web browser (Remote UI).¶You cannot set EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS/PEAP at the same time.¶¶EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security)¶Authentication using the EAP-TLS method requires both the client machine and the RADIUS server to issue their digital certificates to each other. The key and certificate (in PKCS#12 format) sent from the machine are verified using the CA certificate on the RADIUS server. The server certificate sent from the RADIUS server is verified using the CA certificate on the client.¶EAP-TTLS (Tunneled TLS)¶EAP-TTLS requires only the RADIUS server to issue a digital certificate. The server certificate sent from the RADIUS server is verified using the CA certificate on the client machine. The client machine is required to provide the user name/login name and password in order to authenticate itself to the server. As an internal authentication protocol, MS-CHAPv2 or PAP is available for selection.¶PEAP (Protected EAP)¶When PEAP is selected, only the RADIUS server issues a digital certificate. The server certificate sent from the RADIUS server is verified using the CA certificate on the client machine. The client machine is required to provide the user name/login name and password in order to be authenticated by the server. With PEAP, the machine uses MS-CHAPv2 as the internal authentication protocol.¶Selecting the IEEE802.1X Authentication Method¶Follow the procedure below to enable the IEEE802.1X authentication and select the EAP method.¶NOTE¶Before you select the IEEE802.1X Settings, make sure that the required key pairs and digital certificates are registered in the machine.

(Restricting Access from Computers on the Network)¶¶NOTE¶If Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/Server 2003/Server 2008 or Mac OS X (10.4.9 or later) is on your network, you can set up a print server for more efficient management of network printers. Once a print server is set up, it can manage the print jobs. Also, by setting up a driver for the print server, the printer driver can be installed in each computer via the network.¶¶Printer Connection Method (LPD/Raw)¶The procedure described in this section is for specifying the port setting.¶NOTE¶If you are using Windows Vista, a dialog box may be displayed while you are performing the procedure. In this case, enter a user name and password. For more information, see the manuals provided with the operating system.¶¶Installing a New Driver¶Install the driver according to the procedures indicated below, found in the manual for each driver. For Macintosh, see the Mac Printer Driver Installation Guide.¶If you want to use the UFRII LT/PCL/PS printer driver: See the installation procedures in the Printer Driver Installation Guide. (See Chapter 3, “Accompanying CD-ROMs,” in the User’s Guide.)¶If you want to use the fax driver: See the installation procedures in the Fax Driver Installation Guide. (See Chapter 3, “Accompanying CD-ROMs,” in the User’s Guide.)¶NOTE¶On Windows, the default printing protocol will be Raw if the driver has been installed according to the Printer Driver Installation Guide. If you wish to use LPD as the printing protocol, change the settings after the driver is installed. For details, see Changing the Port after Installing the Driver.¶¶Changing the Port after Installing the Driver¶NOTE¶For Macintosh, change the network configurations of your printer in the [Print &amp; Fax] setting in [System Preferences].
